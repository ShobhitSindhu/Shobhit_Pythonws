You have been hired to build a management system for a new boutique ice cream shop, "Scoops & Scripts." The shop owner needs a robust program that ensures the menu remains permanent, prices are easily searchable, and order history is tracked accurately.

Project Requirements
Your task is to implement a system using Python that handles different types of data with specific constraints:

Fixed Offerings: The basic flavors (Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry) are the shop's signature and should never be accidentally changed or deleted during the program's execution.

Pricing Lookup: Each flavor has a specific price. The system must quickly find the cost of a flavor to calculate a customer's bill.

Strict Serving Rules: To prevent inventory errors, the shop only allows two types of serving: Cone or Cup. This rule is set in stone and must be immutable.

Customization: Customers can choose multiple toppings. These toppings should be unique (you can't have "nuts" twice), and the order doesn't matter.

Transaction Tracking: The system must maintain a running history of every successful sale made throughout the day so that the manager can review them at closing.
